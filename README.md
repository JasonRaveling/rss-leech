# RSS Leech
Simply put, a WordPress plugin that adds widgets that grab RSS feeds from the feed URL.

This plugin creates a widget based on the PHP files in the `widgets` directory, caches the feed and images, parses from the local cache, then serves them.

This plugin was made to be as simple as possible. Features will be added as the need arises. For now, functionality for creating widgets from the admin area (not just hard coded widgets) is a possibility. Resizing the cached images within the plugin will hopefully be added soon.
